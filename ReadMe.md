ðŸ’£ Stewart Platform Ball Ballancer ðŸ’£
   ===============================
   

This is a repository containing works performed over the period of five months to create working 
model of Stewart Platform ball ballancer. Problems encountered were not that trivial i thought 
they would be, but eventually i was figuring them out on my own while doing a lot of thinking and 
testing. The process of creating this project would go like this:

1. Concept - I saw this really cool balancing table, i wonder if I can do similiar on my 
own.

2. Two Crappy prototypes not yet implementing Stewart Platform (SP) kinematics - I can go 
into details here on demand, but i don't think it's worth it.

3. Stewart platform kinematics implemented into device geometry. I had to spend a lot of 
time in the workshop trying to get perfect wooden hexagons (i should 3d print them).
	
4. While having fun in the workshop and wood tools i didn't think much about kinematics
to be implemented and how tricky it would get to create detailed vector model that won't 
make my fairly strong servos ripp spherical joints apart. So yeah, you need to have 
decently precise measurments of your geometry to be in the business.

5. Here's where fun begins, once having kinematics in place you can just plug joystick
of your choice and play with ROLL & PITCH variables which are being converted by inverse 
kinematics algorithm into Servos positions. Being a bit concerned about time management
i used servo.h library, its not going to change the fact that you should know how PWM 
works! This is also a place that i thought is the tip of the hill i am on - false.
	
6. To be able to actuate six arms required by geometry of the platform (you can achieve 
the same with only two if you are resourcefull enough) you need at least equal number
of Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) hardware outputs embedded in your microcontroller/processor.
I've used M328P, it has enough PWM pins, and its fast to prototype and sent code to it
as arduino is using the same. The thing i don't like about the lattest is being pretty big
so i chose to shrinken it a bit.

7. Having my superpowers of providing pitch and roll i started to think how to make it 
listen to my 15" resistive touch panel which came from china after more than month of 
waiting (3/4 of this time was laying in the polish customs office). The task seemed quite 
easy: i have two angles and a 15" plane, lets just treat it as a xy coordinate system and 
feed them into the inverse kinematic algorithm, this idea is called a proportional 
controll.

8. Little did i know that 5 wire resistive touch panels require having a driver connected
to them (yes, i didn't have it). First i had to figure out the algorithm behind reading 
coordinates and later on discover that it's not sufficient condition to get them. Data  
i was collecting (XY coordinates) didn't make any sense and even i was making physically 
straight line, the output was showing beautiful however undesirable graph
shaped like rotated 45degree clockwise letter "S".

After few days of thinking and not having much time to work on the project I have read
somewhere about stray capacitance, applying 3ms read delay gives
them enough time to discharge to give me a proper read.  

9. I placed touch panel on my precious SP. Every automatics 
engineer will tell you that proportional control is not going to take you far when 
dealing with more complex and delicate dynamic systems, i had to go for over 100 hundred 
years old idea called PID controll.

10. PID (Proportional - Integral - Derrivative) can be described as a sum of three terms
each describing a diferent signal characteristic:
	- P is responsible for Proportional control signal change.
	- I takes care of integrating a static error existing after P and D stop working.
	- D Derrivative (my favourite) deals with fast changes and represents signal rate
	of change. D deals with fast changes in signal, what results in really impressive.
	system reaction.

11. I took each PID term, multiplied it by some coefficient (i got them by trial and 
error) and out their sum into roll and pitch. For some systems you can use zigler-nichols 
method for example Or matlab if you have system transfer function.	
	
for sure i forgot to mention 60% of stuff so sorry for that, i am writing this over 6 
months after having my thesis defended.
